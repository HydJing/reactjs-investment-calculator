### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/reactjs-investment-calculator.git
    cd reactjs-investment-calculator

## Usage

To run the development server:

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.

yarn build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready static files.
